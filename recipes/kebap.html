        <p><h3> Preparation</h3></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak wooden skewers in water <strong>at least 30 minutes</strong> to prevent them from burning.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the ground meat, chopped onion, minced garlic, parsley, cumin, coriander, paprika, salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li>Use your hands to mix all the ingredients together until well combined.</li>
            <li>Divide the meat mixture into small portions and shape them into long, sausage-like cylinders.</li>
            <li>Thread the meat cylinders onto the skewers, pressing and shaping them gently with your hands to ensure they stick together.</li>
            <li>Preheat your grill or grill pan over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Place the kebabs on the grill and cook for about 4-5 minutes per side, or until they are browned and cooked through.</li>
            <li>Turn the kebabs occasionally to ensure even cooking.</li>
            <li>Once cooked, remove the kebabs from the grill and let them rest for a few minutes before serving.</li>
            <li>Serve the kebabs hot with your choice of accompaniments such as pita bread, tzatziki sauce, hummus, grilled vegetables, or a fresh salad.</li>
